        <h1>welcome.</h1>
        <p>in a castle, lies an utterly chaotic warlock.
            <br>eager to conquer the world through his gloomy poetry, he finds beauty in the interweave of tragedy with hope, and the transformation of failure into triumph.
            <br>although the art of creation can be tricky and bittersweet – at minimum – his passion for making dreams come true seems to conquer any obstacle.</p>
